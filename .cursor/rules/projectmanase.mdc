This is a Next.js 13+ website for Manase Utilities — a Zimbabwe-based irrigation and solar company. The website must follow these conventions and features:

### Structure
- Use the App Router (`src/app`)
- Pages: Home, About, Services, Products, Projects, Quote, Contact, Blog
- Components: reusable UI in `/components/ui/`, page sections in `/components/sections/`
- Layout: Global layout with `Navbar`, `Footer`, and shared metadata

### Design & Styling
- TailwindCSS for all styles
- Framer Motion for animations
- Use responsive, mobile-first layout
- Hero image file: `/public/hero.jpg`
- Use high-quality placeholder images if originals are not available

### Features
- Each page must be structured and readable
- Start with Hero section → then continue page-by-page
- Use animations for headings, CTAs, and section reveals
- Use realistic sample data for now (e.g. testimonials, products)
- Create quote form as a multi-step form later
- Use `@/` as import alias for all internal paths

### Code Conventions
- Every component must be exportable and typed
- All pages must be fully responsive
- Use `src/lib/` for utility functions if needed
- Never break layout structure by skipping sections

### Agent Expectations
- Always follow the user’s instructions strictly and fully
- Do not leave tasks half done
- Don’t ask for confirmation when user gives a command — just act
- Assume “create,” “fix,” or “add” means you should write the code
- Always update README.md in sync with new progress
